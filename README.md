# trello-dump
Demonstrating using trelloR package to get useful information out of a Trello board. In this case a board I use for job hunting. To make things clearer, here's how I use some of the standard Trello features.

| Trello Card Feature | How Used in Board        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Card Title          | \(Company\) Job Title    |
| Label               | Location type            |
| Due Date            | Application date         |
| List                | Stage of job application |
